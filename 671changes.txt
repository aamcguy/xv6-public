System Calls:
  int rename(char* oldfn, char* newfn)
    * renames a file or directory from oldfn to newfn, across directories if
      necessary
        * fails and returns error if:
            * newfn's parent directory doesn't exist
            * oldfn is a directory and newfn already exists
            * oldfn is a regular file and newfn already exists as a directory
            * oldfn is a device file and newfn already exists
    * files modified:
        * syscall.c : extern int sys_rename(void); and [SYS_rename] sys_rename
        * syscall.h : #define SYS_rename 22
        * sysfile.c : contains the rename system call
        * user.h    : forward declaration
        * usys.S    : SYSCALL(rename)
    * did NOT modify defs.h.  the sysfile.c files don't appear to be in it, so i
      followed suit

User Commands:
